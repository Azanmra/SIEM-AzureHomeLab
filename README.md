<h1>SIEM Azure Honeypot Homelab</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consists of a simple honeypot home lab in azure, honeypots act as decoy systems, purposefully set up to lure and observe malicious activity. This offers deep insights into potential threats and the tactics used by attackers. A SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) system serves as a centralized solution for collecting, analyzing, and responding to security events in real time. With Azure Sentinel—Microsoft’s cloud-native SIEM, the user will gain a unified view of the security landscape, enhanced by automated threat detection and response capabilities. Step into my homelab, where we track live attacks from across the globe and visually display on a world map to show severity.
